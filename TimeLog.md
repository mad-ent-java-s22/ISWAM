| 1/27| Set up | 1 | Did I do this right? |
| 1/23 - 1/29 | Java week 3 | 29 | I kind of forgot about logging this week. I use the clockify app to track the general subjects I'm studying - I had 30 for last week. Most of it was doing work directly related to this class but some is more general Java, like tutorials I watch on Pluralsight or LinkedIn Learning. I'll keep better track this week of particular activities. |
| 1/30 | Exercise 3 | 2 | |
| 1/30 | Week 3 videos | 1 | |
| 1/31 | Ex 3 | 2 | Just about finished exercise 3. |
